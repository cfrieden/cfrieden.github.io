# Fun Camel Facts

This was a fun experiment to build a simple website using html, css, javascript and jquery.

Why Camels?
1. They are cool.
2. In 2012, I wrote a final paper for a geography course about transportation through Northern Africa. I distinctly remember a 20 page requirement being set. Therefore, I completed enough research for a 20 page paper. However, when I sat down to write I realized the maximum page limit was 6 pages double-spaced. The extra facts have been bouncing around my head ever since.

Please enjoy!
